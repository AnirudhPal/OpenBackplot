# OpenBackplot

What is OpenBackplot?

It is intended to be a G-Code Visualizer in which multiple users can edit a shared document simultaneously. For each document a unique id to the link will be added to access the document. Anyone that knows the link can be able to access to the document. We plan to support simulation of the FANUC-NC standard of G-Code intended for CNC Mills and Lathes.

How does the G-Code is Interpreted?

G-Code will be converted to an internal code which will provide the data to draw the lines and bezier curves. The format is "Type" X VAL Y VAL Z VAL X1 VAL Y1 VAL Z1 VAL SPEED. The format of the internal code will be like this.
